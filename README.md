# Readme Generator

A simple application for generating readme files inspired by [readme.so](https://readme.so/)

## Roadmap

- [ ] snippet mode (press tab to move to the next value, typing changes current placeholder text)
- [x] add custom section templates (user created sections that can be added to a readme file)
- [ ] add custom readme templates (readme templates created from the section templates)
- [ ] maybe allow for section, readme and global variables (once the value is set in snippet mode, all occurences get replaced with the value)
- [x] save section templates as yaml files
- [ ] move to the next/prev section functionality
- [ ] save readme (as yaml)
- [ ] add window to create a new readme template (and display available readme templates)
- [ ] copy readme to clipboard
- [ ] move section up/down
- [ ] edit section
- [ ] delete section
- [ ] edit readme template
- [ ] delete readme template
- [x] add selection wrappers for the currently selected text (to make text italic, bold, create links etc.)
- [ ] maybe add tab completion for tab triggers
- [ ] maybe add a way to insert emojis
- [ ] maybe add the option to import a templates list file and combine the imported templates with the currently saved ones. It would also be nice to have a "new" tag for recently added section and readme templates
- [ ] maybe change the font and make it a bit larger
- [ ] section window should focus the name field
- [ ] maybe rightclick should remove items from lists
- [x] selecting a section should jump to the first replacement match
- [ ] see if it is possible to show an adorner (like a tab keyboard key image) at the current cursor position when tab expansion is available
- [ ] maybe add a check icon if a section in the selected sections list hass no placeholder values in its body
- [ ] the readme output should probably not be editable
